# Jet Set Willy (BBC)

This is a disassembly/reassembly of Jet Set Willy for the BBC Micro.

    jsw1.a
    jsw1.5.a

It is based on a previous disassembly http://www.level7.org.uk/miscellany/jet-set-willy-disassembly.txt which is (I think) the cassette version

This code assembles (using the ACME assembler) to create a byte for byte identical copy of the original game.

The binary of the original game can be found here http://www.bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=439
